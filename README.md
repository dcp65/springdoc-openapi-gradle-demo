# springdoc-openapi-gradle-demo

This is an attempt to create a Webflux demo for the springdoc-openapi-gradle-plugin.

It is based on the Webflux demo in the [springdoc-openapi-demos](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi-demos) project, which uses Maven.

To write an `openapi.json` to the root of your `build` directory run:

`./gradlew generateOpenApiDocs`
